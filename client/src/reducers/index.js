/*Redux doesn't care how you store the stateâ€”it can be a plain object,
 *an Immutable object, or anything else. You'll probably want a (de)serialization
 *mechanism for writing universal apps and hydrating their state from the server,
 *but other than that, you can use any data storage library as long as it supports immutability. */
